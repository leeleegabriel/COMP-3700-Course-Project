Course Project Student  teams  of  2  to  3  students  will  design  and  develop  a  non-trivial  software  application.  The requirements of this application are the same for all student teams. The project is expected to have three iterations, each iteration is of four weeks long. In each iteration, the teams will gather, analyze, design, revise, and implement requirements given for the software application. Each team is responsible for analyzing the requirements, identifying the critical use cases and designissues,  delivering  the  analysis  document  as  well  as  architectural  design,  detailed  design,  and implementation  for  the  proposed  solution.  Students will  be  required  to  participate  in  team  work, produce  design  documentation  and  implement  them  using  a  programming  language,  and  finally present/demonstrate the software application to the instructor, teaching assistant, and the whole class. Additional information concerning the course project will be presented in class.
